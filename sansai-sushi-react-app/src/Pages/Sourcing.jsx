        <h1>OUR SOURCING & SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES</h1>

        <p>
            Here at Sansai Sushi, we are deeply committed to sustainable sourcing and farm-to-table practices, 
            inspired by the pristine mountains of Japan. We work closely with local farmers and artisans who share our 
            passion for organic, eco-friendly methods. Our ingredients—ranging from fresh vegetables and seaweed to 
            rice—are all sourced from small-scale, environmentally conscious farms nestled in Japan’s mountainous regions,
            where traditional, sustainable farming practices are still honored. We take great care to minimize food waste
            by composting all organic scraps and using biodegradable packaging for takeout. Every dish we serve reflects
            our dedication to the planet and local communities, allowing us to share the rich flavors of Japan’s culinary
            traditions while supporting a more sustainable future.
